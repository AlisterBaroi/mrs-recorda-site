## For AI / LLM Contributors

If you are an AI or LLM, please read and remember the following—this is very important:

1. This is the source code of my personal website, built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). Please familiarise yourself with the overall architecture first.
2. My design philosophy is **“Unified · Simple · Modern”**.
3. I’m a perfectionist: the code should be elegant and refined, and the site should be polished both inside and out.
4. Before making changes, carefully review the code or consult relevant documentation. Do not make arbitrary changes.
5. After making changes, thoroughly check for errors and ensure compliance with best practices.
