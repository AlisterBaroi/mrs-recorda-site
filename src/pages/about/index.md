## # Personal Introduction

üéì I am a middle school student from Hangzhou, China.

üíª Passionate about mathematics and programming, enthusiastic about technology, and enjoy exploring new things.

üí° Strong self-learning ability and problem-solving skills, good at independent thinking and hands-on practice.

üõ†Ô∏è Focus on clean and standardized code, pursuing clear structure and consistent style.

‚úçÔ∏è Enjoy organizing the learning process and recording thoughts for convenient communication and sharing.

## # Website Introduction

My personal website for sharing technical notes, project experience, and learning insights.

Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/lailai0916/lailai0916.github.io).

## # My Nickname

My nickname is **lailai**. Since this name is quite common, I often have trouble registering accounts.

To solve this, I usually add my birthday digits **0916**, forming **lailai0916**.

If that is also taken, I convert the digits to hexadecimal **0x394**, forming **lailai0x394**.

:::warning

- **lailai** should always be typeset with all lowercase letters, even when it is the first word in a sentence, paragraph, or title.
- **lailai** is untranslatable content and should always be set in English, even when it appears within text in a language other than English.
